# IBIS_English_Dataset
IBIS_English_Dataset, is an annotated discussion elements dataset that focuses on IBIS (Issue, Idea, Pros, Cons &amp; N_A) as discussion tree. The dataset consist of roughly 2,500 data nodes from 10 different social discussion topics annotated by five annotators.
Each data/node is written by 5 humen agents, and paired labelled with 5 annotators reivews while following IBIS rules based on directed graph.
Each node has relationshio with other nodes while following IBIS based on directed graph.
In short, IBIS_English_Dataset provides a free setting for researchers to train node extractor model and the link extractor model in english.

The IBIS_English_Dataset is under construction and we are working now to migrate the data from the pilot phase of the project into github, so please watch this space.
